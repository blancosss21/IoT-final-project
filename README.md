# IoT-final-project

The projectâ€™s objective is to create a publish-subscribe application protocol, similar in essence to MQTT. In our
project there are two types of motes arranged in a star topology. Node 1 is the PAN coordinator and the other nodes are subscribers/publishers. The tools we are used are TinyOS to create the code of the nodes, Cooja to simulate and test our code, Thingspeak to output our data on graphs and node-RED to link Cooja with Thingspeak.


This project was a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the practical implementation of an IoT application. We learned a lot about IoT, TinyOS and Cooja. We consider a lot of factors when making design decisions and we have a better understanding of the trade-offs that are involved. We also gained a deeper understanding and found interesting to explore the different problematic situations in which an IoT application could get stuck. We learned how to design our application to handle these situations gracefully.
Overall, we are very happy with the outcome of this project: we are confident that this experience will be valuable to us in our future career.
